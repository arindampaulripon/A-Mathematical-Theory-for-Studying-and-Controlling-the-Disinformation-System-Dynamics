connection between disinformation, defined as deliberate spread of false information, and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping), Noise-Inducement, Understanding Subjective Patterns. 
 This study explores the connection between disinformation, defined as deliberate spread of false information, and rate-induced tipping (R-tipping), a phenomenon where systems undergo sudden changes due to rapid shifts in external forces. While traditionally, tipping points were associated with exceeding critical thresholds, R-tipping highlights the influence of the rate of change, even without crossing specific levels. The study argues that disinformation campaigns, often organized and fast-paced, can trigger R-tipping events in public opinion and societal behavior. This can happen even if the disinformation itself doesn't reach a critical mass, making it challenging to predict and control. Here, by Transforming a population dynamics model into a network model, Investigating the interplay between the source of disinformation, the exposed population, and the medium of transmission under the influence of external sources, the study aims to provide valuable insights for predicting and controlling the spread of disinformation. This mathematical approach holds promise for developing effective countermeasures against this increasingly prevalent threat to public discourse and decision-making.
